# Memories from Vassa Atepaeva

Most of the story happens at, or near city [Kungur, Ural mountains](
https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kungur,+Perm+Krai,+Russia).

Let these notes to become the start of the family history of our family. They
also might be interesting as description of situation the family was going
through, where small details will tell about the bigger picture.

My place of birth is the village Voronino, Yugo-Osokin part of the Perm region.
It was located about 20 miles from the city Kungur.

People who decided to found the village probably picked it because of lakes.
Otherwise it is hard to understand why would they build their houses 1.5 miles
from a river. It would be a strange decision.

However the place is really beautiful, the view is amazing, especially from the
spot where our ancestors built our house. The house was placed close to the top
of the mountain, right in front of a small lake that filled a karstic funnel.
Further, after fences and houses on the other side of the village road there
were wheat fields, and then, far away, a forest. No major roads crossed the
village, so it was a quiet peaceful place. Only 2-way path created by wheels of
peasant's carriages divided the village in halves. There were about 50 houses
in the village. The road lead down from our home, there were 3 other houses on
one side and 1 house on the other. Higher our house the road forked with higher
and lower ends. The higher end sported a communal well, it was very deep.

All village had been surrounded with a fence made from wood planks, there were
two gates on two sides of the village. The gates were kept closed with a loop
made of rope. Both sides of the outlets lead down and both slopes where quite
steep. One lead towards the river, and another towards the large village Lensk
(old name Stepanovo). The carriages' wheels and rivulets of water cut deep
trenches in the clay of the road. Behind our house beyond the village fence
there was a deep canyon covered with trees. In the spring, when the snow
melted, the canyon became a fast deep river. The fast-running watter polished
slices of sandstone, creating perfectly smooth tiles of stone, about an inch
deep. We used these tiles to cover pots and as a building material. An
underground storage room was made out of these slabs, and they were also used
as the foundation of our house.

We had a large garden and a grassland spot for animals next to the house. At
the end of the garden there was banya and the trees of "черемуха". In the
middle of the grassland parcel there was a large white stone made of gypsum. It
was great to sit on the stone and look towards Lensk --- it had a huge
white-yellow church and a large stout school made of red bricks. The church and
the school had 2 floors. These far-away buildings were framed by houses,
fields, the forest, and the view was breath-taking. I could look at this beauty
for long long time and it never bothered me. I even often had an urge to look
in that direction.

I was fascinated and amazed by our house. It created an air of reliability,
high-quality, and reflected a serious attitude towards life of the people who
did build it. It was over a hundred years old. It differed from most of
peasants houses (izbas) by having the outsied to be covered by thin planks of
wood, and it had not only the kitchen, but also a living room, and it
considered to be a rarity. The street face had 5 big well-made windows. They
were painted white. The backyard side had 2 windows. On of the backyard windows
had a sliding frame. From the inside the walls were covered  with plaster ---
another rarity. In the center of a ceiling of the living room there was a hook
for kerosene lamp. The hook was surrounded by an ornamental circle embedded
into the plaster. Floors, sitting benches and shelves, all were painted with
a such a strong paint, that it served through the whole life of the house.
The floor and benches were made from planks about 20 inch wide. The main side
of the room (red corner in Russian, where red word also means beautiful)
contained icons of the Orthodox faith, and a table. The table did not have a
cover, or finish, but was a well-polished natural wood. There were also 2-3
chairs, and a few large spindles from a loom, that we use as stools.

The room also had a wooden bed, a cupboard. Next to the icons there was a
painting of a Verhotusk monastery. The kitchen had a large russian stove made
of bricks covered in plaster with a large wide sleeping bench as a continuation
of the stove.  There was another wide bench also for sleeping in the kitchen.
Next to it there as an entry to the storage basement.

Our huge backyard was surrounded by a wall made of tree trunks, part of the
backyard was covered with a roof. The backyard had an underground storage,
stables, garage. There were big gates towards the garden for horses, and a door
for humans. Under the roof we kept farm machinery, horse-propelled sleds for
winter and other utensils. At some point there was a fenced place for sheep
and goats too.

The name of my grand-grand dad was Afanasiy. I do not know much about him.

My grandfather, Mihey Afanasievich Chastuhin was a sickly man. Something
depressed him. Apparently at some point he tried to commit suicide. In 1914 he
was taken to serve as a sergeant during the World War 1. I saw his letters. I
could see that he was a literate man with a beautiful handwriting. He died in
1916. My grandmother's name was Alexandra Maximovna Chastuhina. She was tall,
thin, self-contained. After the death of my granddad she was left alone with 4
daughters. The oldest of them was my mom. She was 10 years old in 1914. So much
for the main worker of the family. Her grandad Afanasij had been too old by
then, so she had to do a lot of work to keep everything running.

Now lets talk about my grandma. Grandmothers are usually affectionate towards
to their grand children, but Alexandra, as she was known in the village, was
kind to all people. Her good nature made other people to like her. People were
saying that through the whole her life she did not loose temper or quarreled
with anyone. I do not remember one time when she was angry at me. She patiently
endured not very nice character of her daughter Olga, who lived with her in her
old age.

Alexandra did not join the collective pharm, lived by using resources provided
by her house and attached to it land. She cultivated a huge garden, took care
of her cattle, baked bread, cooked and did home chores. She was always busy,
and always kept her calm and kind nature. She was only quarreled with a piglet
who tried to steal food from the backyard. Her curse was in this case "Drain in
the river".

I think my love to nature and its beauty comes from my grandma. She always drew
my attention to our surrounding, and would say: "Look how beautiful it is".  We
often went with het to collect berries and mushrooms. We did not collect much,
just enough for one meal. My grandma collected mushrooms into her apron, and
when we would get over a ravine, we would sit on it edge to rest and she would
say: "Look at this beauty. I do not want to die, after death you cannot see
such amazing things".

Out of her 4 daughers the grandma loved my mom more than others, probably she
thought that she was better and kinder than her other 3 daughters. While she
still could make long trips, she would walk 15 km to our home in the city and
bring small presents she made, pirogies with potato or millet. They were
heavenly tasty. I remember how she would listen my stories about new life. She
was completely illiterate, so she could only receive information through
talking, but she did not like empty or small talk, and did not visit her
neighbors just to gossip. She did not listen radio because she thought it was
against her faith. One time she went to a movie theater and watched a movie
made out of Pushkin's novel "Dubrovsky". She liked it very much, but did not go
anymore, she said it is "sin".

Sometimes my parent remembered with a smile, how my grandma, would chase to a
window seing a person walking or riding by, and tried to understand who are
they, where and to whom do they go. It was especially funny, when she did
visited us in the city. We lived in a basement, the window only showed people's
legs, and the grandma was trying to figure out whom the legs belonged to. She
had a stoic attitude to her misfortunes and afflictions. She died in winter, 82
years old.

My father -- Atepaev Nicolay Ivanovich (1905-1945yy). I loved my mom so
strongly, that to a surprise of the whole village, married her, a widow with a
child, and joined a family with so many dependents -- granma, my mom with her
dauther, and three her sisters.My dad was a daring young man. Often would pick
fights with others, even after his marriage, but later he settled down. I
remember him as a calm and a very taciturn man.  He was a passionate fisherman
and a hunter. It was surprising for others, because he had a bad
nearsightedness, however he never wear glasses. In the city he worked as a
carpenter, and his clothes always smell like a fresh wood. He was a humble man,
never could ask anything for himself, so he, a good carpenter, did not have his
own house. I remember that during holidays, he would drink a little and try to
dance. It looked funny, like a dancing bear.

He probably was a just man, because he was elected as the head of our yard
(yard was formed by 4-5 houses, like a small commune of tenants of the houses).
In his understanding of his duty, it meant to keep the yard ordered and clean,
and he was keeping it this way with a visible pleasure. Every spring he would
cut lilac flowers, and distribute it between tenants. He was often on call to
resolve tenants' conflicts. He did not like this part of the job, but somehow
managed it too. His kindness is telling in his attitude towards his
stepdaugher, my sister Klava. She only learned that she is not his own when she
got her passport, 16 years old. She cried, because she wanted to be Atepaeva,
not Ivanova (the family name of her deceased father). I remember how during war
he tied to give his share of bread to Klava or me.

Another telling story -- how he dealt with the sister of my mom, Olga. She
married a man from a different village, and somehow it did not work out. She
suffered and cried a lot. My dad came to visit her one day. She cried again.
Then Nicolay Ivanovich (his village short name was Kol'sha) said: "Gather up
your things, I am taking you back home". Olga felt gratitude towards him all
her life. She started to live with my grandma as "separated", it was very rare
then. I remember him brining home small pieces of wood as toys for me, and very
tasty meat pirogies that he was given at work.

In the spring, when the water in Sylva-river was muddy, he used to take me
fishing using a round net (1,5m diameter) on a 3m stick. We would submerge the
net into the water, wait a bit and take it out. Water would leave through
holes, and fish would stay. I collected it into a bucket. I do not remember
every getting a big fish this way. Mom would fry it with eggs. I did not eat
the fish, because I did not like to struggle with its small bones.

Two times my dad scared me. One time, accidentally, he dropped a hot ash from
his hand-rolled cigarette behind the collar of my dress, and second time, when
he fired his hunting gun at home. From that time, or may be just by my nature,
I cannot stand loud sounds. Why did he do it, I do not know, may be to scare my
mom for fun, or because he missed hunting so much. My dad was big friend with
unkle Michael, he was the husband of aunt Katya, my mom's sister. My dad was
very upset when we got a message that Michael was killed during World War 2. He
did not sleep whole night, walked back and forth in the kitchen and smoked one
cigarette after another. I recall, how my dad strained his ankle, when he was
walking from his work drunk. My mom took him to the hospital, and scolded him
terribly, cried, she was afraid he will be arrested. Everything worked out well
in the end, but later my mom was saying that if he was arrestd, he would be
alive now.
